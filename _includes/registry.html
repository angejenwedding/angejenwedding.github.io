For example, some of you may follow a tradition of giving envelopes, or others may follow a tradition of buying gifts off of a registry. We want everyone to follow what makes them the most comfortable. We've created a small <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/wedding/ange-strom-weber-jen-mcteague-providence-april-2019/registry/2XG7293V0U25V&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1546650834265000&usg=AFQjCNHDQqPMoBJF1C23RcyvK2_bhfWVzw" target="_blank">registry</a> for those who would prefer to buy a gift. Since the registry is very limited, it would be helpful for those of you who don't have a strong tradition of gift registries to leave this option for those who do. If you are someone who can make puzzles, we would love to receive puzzles from you. They could be wedding themed, but certainly don't have to be â€“ we would appreciate puzzles of any theme. Because we have a small apartment and we have almost everything we need, we would also appreciate gift certificates to any of the stores that we shop at regularly:</p>
